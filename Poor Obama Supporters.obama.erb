<h1>Obama fucks up</h1>

A prescient blogger wrote "this piece":http://svs.webfactional.com/blog/?p=22 last November, which immediately drew flak from all across the globe. Now, a year after Obama's election and the humongous slide in his popularity to below 50%, we see yet again that old thesis - power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely - being borne out. Proletarians who look to the heavens for deliverance will always be disappointed. The system will never wreck itself. The prescient blogger, seeing the world through a (gasp!) Marxist lens avoided being fooled while the rest of the world went into gushing adoration. That prescient blogger is, of course, me on a different blog. Here is another very smart man on Obama - Matt Taibbi writes on "Obama's Big Sellout":http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/31234647/obamas_big_sellout in Rolling Stone

Proles, everyday I marvel at the twists of logic that the human mind is capable off in arriving at its conclusions. Our naivete is unmatched in nature. Kick a cat once and it will avoid you for life, but you can piss on humans forever provided you tell them a nice story while doing it. Ooooh look, he's black. Conclusion? He is on our side. Wow! 

Everyday you see around you evidence that the system of limitless accumulation of power is leaving you voiceless and yet you live your life as though you yourself will someday have limitless power. You dream of it as you hang from the straps, hurtling past the slums and MHADA colonies by the tracks. You continue to choose between Congress, BJP, Shiv Sena, MNS or whatever other party you may care to name as though it makes a difference - as though these are not all ultimately leading to the same choice - rule by corruption. You worship money, when what you need is a clean city, a comfortable commute, a decent amount of leisure, good healthcare and education for your children. You live as though it is just a matter of time before you break through into the privileged club of millionaires. Meanwhile, the end of the line arrives and you have to get off. 

Now that the prole's disappointment with Barack is getting through to their conscious minds, it might be useful to talk about propaganda, the endless barrage of messages, liminal and subliminal, that you receive through the day. Just like the worship of Obama during his election, all these messages from the mainstream media have an agenda. Sometimes, like with advertising, the agenda is very overt. At other times, it is in better taste to keep the agenda hidden, but there is always an agenda. One of the messages you always receive is connected with a very simple word - anarchy. Immediately your mind sees a rioting mob, a strapping young lad hurling a Molotov cocktail while looters carry away other people's private property. Am I right? The word anarchy has been made to mean so much like disorder and chaos that we cannot even consider the term anymore without asking - but with no ruler, why would there be any order? This response is typicalof people who have been taught to always see their fellow man as a competitor, to see humans as greedy and violent beings and who will always prefer a despotic ruler to no ruler at all. Who will accept Barack Obama and his Wall Street handlers before they will trust the instincts of their neighbour.

I leave you with a link to the "Barcelona Anarchists"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Spain, active in Spain before the civil war, and hopefully, a thought on how to live life without this parasitic political system and the rule of the few over the many.
