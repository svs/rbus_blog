<h1>Why States Are Getting Smaller In India</h1>

Of course, the reasons why states are getting smaller has nothing to do with foresightedness by the political class. It is purely symptomatic of the decentralisation of power going on everywhere, European Union not withstanding.

The decentralisation of power has its roots in the role of energy and information in the shaping of society. All society is shaped by its power structures, and power flows from only two sources - access to energy and access to information. For millenia, when the access to energy was easier than the access to information (imagine a medieval European king who has access to a lot of farmland but no books or literate people), it was the access to energy resources that shaped society. However, there was always a class of merchants and scientists who made their living through the exchange and analysis of information. This is the class that broke the stranglehold of the clergy on people's minds and started a process of decentralising information, of which the Internet is today's manifestation. Today, information carries with it more transformational power than energy alone. Today, freelancers are able to perform collectively the jobs of organisations precisely because of the rapidity of information exchange as well as the presence of an information commons on the Internet. Thus empowered, they are changing the traditional roles of managers and organisations. This same process is at play everywhere.

I am not saying that the current demands for separate states are motivated by well informed people for the purpose of delivering justice. It is simply a symptom of this decentralising force that is in play today. Andhra politicians know that while the IT industry of the state is in Hyderabad, it is indeed possible to recreate the same conditions in Vizag, and this time they can get in the game earlier. The supremely critical strategic location of Hyderabad has been rendered irrelevant by the Internet. Hyderabad is a plum, but it is not the only one. This is just one possible explanation.

Symptoms like the European Union may seem contrary to this trend, but taking away exchange rate risks on transactions between Germany and Belgium have massive effects when it comes to leveling the playing field for smaller businesses in Belgium in this example. It might seem like a Union, but it is de-centralising in its economic effects. AP and Telangana already share the same currency.

The Federal Model will not go away easily. An economically and politically weakened Center will push for either greater military strength or coercive police powers. This is the danger of Central mechanisms of coercion. States must take whatever measures appropriate to make sure that the coercive powers of the Center remain in check. Definitely desperate moves by the Center in India such as the talking up of Naxal menace, the deployment of the army and the UID scheme are all towards the same end. It is too late for the Center to impose UID. This is not some PAN number for 15 million odd people. We are talking about billions of people here. If the Center wants greater security and a UID, it should educate the masses and let them loose on the Internet. They will create their own schemes of recognition and trust. A powerful central army deployed inside the borders of the Republic will be fatal to the long term viability of the Indian nation. Its existence will take on a logic of its own, until civil war becomes the norm. The drain on public resources and the distraction from the mission of educating, feeding and keeping the population happy will push Indian civilization below the critical level of intellectuals and scientists required to maintain a productive society. The middle class will become managerial serfs with exotic titles, mostly poor but with immense riches juuust out of their grasp. The rest of India will be available for resource plunder by the politcal classes.

Decentralisation is a powerful force, but it needs all the help it can get. Demand smaller and more accountable organs of government, starting from your local neighbourhood committee to Central government. Create decentralised power structures in your neighbourhood and in your city. Without these new power structures to balance out the immense capacity of violence that the Center can weild, things could get and continue to remain pretty ugly.
